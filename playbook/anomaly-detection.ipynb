        "Anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the process of identifying rare items, events, observations, or data points that deviate significantly from the vast majority of the data and do not conform to a well-defined notion of normal behavior.  In essence, its about finding the unusual or unexpected in a sea of normal. "

        "2. **Contextual Anomalies:** A data point that is anomalous only within a specific context.  The same value might be normal in a different context.\n",
        "   - **Example:** A user logging into a system at 3AM from their usual IP address might be normal if they're a night shift worker, but anomalous if they typically only log in during business hours.  \n",
        "3. **Collective Anomalies:** A group of related data points that, when considered together, are anomalous, even if individual data points within the group might appear normal.\n",

        "- **Statistical Methods:** These use basic mathematical models to identify outliers based on predefined norms.  \n",
        "   - **Z-Scores:** Measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. \n",
        "   - **Interquartile Range (IQR):** Defines a normal range based on the middle 50% of the data, flagging anything outside this range. \n",
        "\n",
        "- **Machine Learning Methods:** These learn from historical data to recognize anomalies.\n",
        "   - **Clustering-based:** Algorithms like K-Means group similar data points together.  Points that don't fit well into any cluster are considered anomalies.\n",
        "   - **Density-based:** Algorithms like Local Outlier Factor (LOF) identify anomalies based on how isolated a data point is from its neighbors.\n",
        "   - **Isolation Forest:** Uses an ensemble of decision trees to efficiently isolate anomalies.  Anomalies are typically easier to isolate than normal data points.\n",
        "   - **Support Vector Machines (SVMs):** Can be extended to one class SVMs to learn the boundaries of normal data and detect points outside these boundaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Deep Learning Methods:** These employ complex neural networks for detecting even the subtlest and most complex irregularities, especially in high dimensional or time series data. \n",
        "   - **Autoencoders:** Neural networks trained to reconstruct their input.  Anomalies are typically poorly reconstructed, leading to higher reconstruction errors.\n",
        "   - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)/(LSTMs):** Well-suited for time-series data, they can learn sequential patterns and detect deviations from these patterns."
