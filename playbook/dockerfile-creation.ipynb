        "### **Basic Structure and Key Instructions**\n",
        "\n",
        "A Dockerfile typically starts with a base image and then adds layers of configurations, dependencies, and application code.  Here are the most common instructions: \n",
        "1. `FROM`:\n",
        "   - **Purpose:** Specifies the base image for your build.  This is usually an official image from Docker Hub (e.g., `ubuntu`, `python`, `node`, `nginx`), it must be the first instruction in a Dockerfile.\n",
        "   - **Example:** `FROM python:3.9-slim-buster` (uses a lightweight Python 3.9 image based on Debian Buster)   \n",
        "\n",
        "2. `WORKDIR`: \n",
        "   - **Purpose:** Sets the working directory fro any `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `COPY`, or `ADD` instructions that follow it.  If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created.\n",
        "   - **Example:** `WORKDIR /app` (all subsequent commands will execute relative to `/app` inside the image). \n",
        "\n",
        "3. `COPY`:\n",
        "   - **Purpose:** Copies new files or directories from the host machine (where your building the image) into the Docker images filesystem.  Its generally preferred over for simple copying.\n",
        "   - **Example:** `COPY . .` (copies everything from the current directory on the host to the `WORKDIR` inside the image)\n",
        "   - **Example:** `COPY requirements.txt .` (copies only `requirements.txt`).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. `RUN`:\n",
        "   - **Purpose:** Executes commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commits the result.  Used for installing software, creating directories, running build scripts, etc.\n",
        "   - **Example:** `RUN opt-get update && opt-get install -y git` (updates package and installs git)\n",
        "   - **Example:** `RUN pop install -f requirements.txt` (installs Python dependencies)\n",
        "\n",
        "5. `EXPOSE`:\n",
        "   - **purpose:** informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime.  It doesn't actually publish the port; its more of a documentation and networking hint. You need to use the `-p` flag with `docker run` to publish the port.\n",
        "   - **Example:** `EXPOSE 8000` (indicates the application inside listens on port 8000)\n",
        "\n",
        "6. `CMD`:\n",
        "   - **Purpose:** Provides default commands and arguments for an executing container.  There can only be one `CMD` instruction in a Dockerfile. If you specify an executable, it will be run.  If you provide arguments, they will be appended to teh ENTRYPOINT instruction (if one exists).\n",
        "   - **Example (executable form):** `CMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]` \n",
        "   - **Example (shell form):** `CMD python app.py` (less preferred as it runs through a shell, losing some ignal handling)\n",
        "\n",
        "7. `ENTRYPOINT`:\n",
        "   - **Purpose:** Configures a container that will run as an executable.  Like `CMD`, there can only be one `ENTRYPOINT`. If both `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` are present, `CMD`s value becomes arguments to the `ENTRYPOINT`.  Often used to set up a fixed command with variable arguments.\n",
        "   - **Example:** `ENTRYPOINT [\"gunicorn\", \"--bind\", \"0.0.0.0:8000\", \"my_app:app\"]`\n",
        "   - **Example:** with CMD:"

        "- **Layer Caching:** order your instructions form least to most frequently changing.  For example, install dependencies (`RUN pip install`) before copying your application code (`COPY . .`), so Docker can cache the dependency installation step if only your code changes.\n",
        "- **Minimize Layers:** Combine multiple `RUN` commands into a simple `RUN` command using `&&` to reduce the number of layers and image size.  Clean up temporary files in the same `RUN` command.  \n",
        "- **Use `.dockerignore`:** Exclude unnecessary files from the build context (e.g., `.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`) to speed up builds and reduce image size.\n",
        "- **Specific Versions:** pin dependencies to specific versions (e.g.,`python:3.9-slim-buster`, `flask==2.3.2`) for reproducibility.\n",
        "- **Non-Root User:** Run your application as a non root user inside the container for security reasons (`User` instruction).\n",
        "- **Multi-stage Builds:** For complex applications, use multistage builds to create smaller, more secure production images by separating build time dependencies from runtime dependencies. \n",
        "   - **Example:** Build a Go binary in one stage, then copy only the binary into a `scratch` or `alpine` image in teh final stage.\n",
        "- **CMD vs. ENTRYPOINT:**\n",
        "Understand their differences and use them appropriately. `ENTRYPOINT` is good for setting up an executable that `CMD` can pass arguments to. \n",
        "- **Health Checks:** Consider adding `HEALTHCHECK` instructions for production containers to tell Docker how to test if a container is still working. "
